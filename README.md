# Amazon Analysis

Background
Since your work with Jennifer on the SellBy project was so successful, you’ve been tasked with another, larger project: analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

In this project, you’ll have access to approximately 50 datasets. Each one contains reviews of a specific product, from clothing apparel to wireless products. You’ll need to pick one of these datasets and use PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Next, you’ll use PySpark, Pandas, or SQL to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset. Then, you’ll write a summary of the analysis for Jennifer to submit to the SellBy stakeholders.


## Tools Used:

- SQL
- PGADMIN

#Summary 
When it comes to tracking customer reviews there are a lot of variables that go into play of the data, although those in with a 5 star are slightly above 50% there is incline for bias in that direction but without more insights it could be very hard to tell. For this datasets sake there is a slight bias but being so close to a true 50 it is hard to make that determination. In this case for future analysis I beleive it is important to get more variable points and crossing information over itself to find the true rate of bias.
